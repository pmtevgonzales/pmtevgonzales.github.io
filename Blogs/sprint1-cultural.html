                    <q>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</q>
                </h4>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        We all make decisions in our every day life. Every morning when the alarms go off we try to decide to sleep in past it or get up to do more productive stuffs. We decide if we're going to drive for work or to bring our own cars and find a parking space in the city. We decide if we're going to buy a bag of chips or a bag of green vegies. Every decisions we make everyday have a vital part in our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        So the question is why is it some decisions in our lives are so hard to make? Simple, because sometimes decision also involved our ethical values and long term consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        As I remember one of the most important and big decision I had to make was about deciding to migrate here in New Zealand with my husband. We migrated in New Zealand and decided to live in the city of Wellington three years ago. Back in the Philippines were I came from, I had a stable job as a Physiotherapist, my husband, my lovely dog Bilbo, my family and friends. When I look at it today, I'm still with my husband, Bilbo is with our family   I constantly get in contact with them and my friends thanks to the internet but I had to leave my job as a Physiotherapist and start over again. I do love my job but I need to think for the future of my family as I always say to myself. I value my family and it is also important to me to grow personally and adapt to changes myself. However looking back to it it's not an easy decision to make because it will involved a long term effect for us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        It was hard for me at first to decide if I'm going to join my husband here in New Zealand or we do a long distance relationship where we do have a different time zones. Good thing is that when I weighed the pros and cons in living here there's a lot of things that this country can offer.  One example is that this in this country it gives you opportunity to shift from one career to another, that leads me to where I am now. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        So why did I start this journey, you ask? This is also one of the recent decisions I had to make. First, I always like the technical side of things and felt disappointed that I could not fix things by myself. Another reason is that a career in web development gives you many possibilities, you can choose between various of work in programming and also various work. As you may have notice by reading this, I get bored easily, so working in an area that is constantly changing and that is always a challenging makes me motivated. Thankfully I always have the support of my husband and my family. I know that without their support and cheers it would not be possible and it will be difficult.
                        I know that I still have a long way to go and a lot of decision to make in each step I take to reach my true goal. I know there will be consequences in this decision that I make but starting over to a new country and a new career doesn't mean that you have failed, rather it's life way of telling us there's another path that we can take as long as our values are intact. Being happy is a matter of choice and decision as well, find a purpose and soon enough it will benefit you.

                <h4 class="description no-indent question">
                    <q>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</q>
                </h4>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        Coming from another country I think one of the culture that my mum and dad influenced me is my faith. Personally I feel that my faith has a big chunk for my identity and values in life. Having a strong faith gives you reason to be more kind, compassionate, honest and humble. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        I give my parents a lot of credit for raising me as I am today and developing what I value in life. If it weren't for them giving me moral compass in life I will not be the person I am now.

                    <q>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</q>
                </h4>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        I believe one of my greatest strength in learning and career development is that I can easily pick up information, can adopt to changes, perfectionist and in the constantly changing world it makes me feel motivated when I'm being challenged.
                    </p>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        In terms of limitations is that not having previous experience in the thing that I'm doing right now and I tend to get stuck on some problems and not ask for help. And I do always think that I can do better in every tasks that I'm working in.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="description no-indent question">

                </h4>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        I believe being perfectionist would really help me in my learning journey here at EDA however this may also hinder me for being hard on myself in achieving perfection to every exercises we will make.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="description no-indent question">
                    <q>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</q>
                </h4>
                    <p class="align-justify description">
                        As a person who is usually shy at first meeting its hard for me to provide my views and ideas when working with a group. But it changes overtime when I'm much more familiar with the team and my other colleagues, I guess this question provides us with how well do we work with other team members who have different views and opinions compare to ours. I remember working in the hospital before and having a different solution with one of my colleague regarding a patients wellbeing. My colleagues is a senior member of the team and he always have the last say on what treatment to provide to patients, but when I look and read through it I find that its an outdated treatment and we can do a much more advance and with the same effectiveness as the outdated one that requires us to maximize our resources. So for me to discuss it to my colleague before is a challenge but I find that its better to talk to him privately and provide my views and opinion as well, also provide him with facts. At the same time as I wanted my theory or solutions to be heard I also want to understand where my colleague is coming from so that we can both empathise and relate with each other. And while having knowledge on both ideas and solution we can definitely come up with the best combination of solution that we can provide for our patient. I reckon if you are having resistance and communication with a team member communication and understanding is the key to have a good work flow. I think some other strategies that can be use to make the discussion light is to provide some icebreaker in between. And I must admit you need to be comfortable with each other to achieve it.
