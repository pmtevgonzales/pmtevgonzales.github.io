                    <p>Reflecting on my learning journey here at EDA and how I plan on achieving my goals.</p>
                    <h4>
                        What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            My long term goal is to become a full stack software developer that can help with the advancement and security of our health care facility in the future. Because thinking of it, our healthcare system here in New Zealand is really behind in terms of technology advancement. We do still use written notes taking that uses lots of papers in our hospitals and some clinics. Its like combining my previous career which is being a Physiotherapist and Web Development at the same time.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            I would really like to develop my confidence, and the way I  communicate with people and other team members. I grew up with a really shy personality and I would like to work on that, so that I can freely speak my thoughts without reservations and hesitations so that there will be no miscommunication and missed opportunity to do better.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        A description of your own strengths and limitations.

                        <p>
                            <b>STRENGTHS:</b>
                            <br>
                            I can say that I'm a quick learner, adaptable, I'm also a good listener and can work with different people with different backgrounds and culture, open to changes and criticisms good or bad. I can also say that I really practice the art of multi tasking well. And know what a good customer support and service is so that I can really help with improving user experience in everything I do. Knowledge in healthcare and banking that can be of used in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>LIMITATIONS</b>
                            <br>
                            One of the limitations that I can think of is really being shy and always afraid to speak my mind in discussions.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            In having the commitment to manage my workload while at EDA I reckon one thing that's need to be essential is your time management skills. That should be a priority specially with flipped classes that we are practicing here in EDA. Having to time yourself with every learning exercise is a good practice as well. Destressing while doing mindfulness activities will also increase productivity in my EDA journey 
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            If I can't really find the solutions on my own and have used all my resources I reckon the best person to ask for help is my facilitator. I can also use the slack channel in code held desk so that other cohort members can provide me with the idea on what I can possible look for, for the solutions I would like to have.  
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            I really do like how the facilitation team is easy to talk to and friendly at the same time especially when I find it hard to understand some terms and jargons in development. And one thought or idea that I can suggest to them is to have like a list of development jargons and terms that can be provided to the students who really don’t have any learning experience with this career.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            Prior in enrolling with EDA I have already planned out and cleaned out all my schedule so that I can focused on my learning in the Foundations and also in Bootcamp. The only thing that is out of plan and also didn't expect is that having myself pregnant within the course but having known about it before the foundation start I have properly arrange all necessary schedule so that it will not interfere with any commitments. I planned out to work for a 40 hrs a week with foundations dividing it into different times per day for the week. By this I'm also making sure that it is beneficial for me and my safety as an expectant mum.
