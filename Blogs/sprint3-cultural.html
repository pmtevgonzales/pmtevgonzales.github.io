                        Understanding the importance of Emotional Intelligence and how it differs from IQ.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is Emotional Intelligence?
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            Emotional Intelligence is the capability of a person to control and manage their emotions. It also involves understanding emotions of other people around you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having the ability to manage and control your emotions can help you solve problems and guide your relationship both at home and work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't fret if you have a low EQ because this is a trainable skills with just a little discipline and practice.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        How is it different to IQ?
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            Intelligence Quotient n the other hand is the measure of a persons intelligence and is expressed in a number which represents ability of logical reasoning. We acquire this as an inborn ability.
                        </p>                       
                        <p>
                            We can explain the differences between EQ and IQ in the following points:
                            <br>
                                → EQ is acquired and improved. As opposed to IQ which is an ability you're born with.<br>
                                → EQ measures individual's social and emotional competencies while IQ measures a person's academic competency and reasoning  ability.<br>
                                → A person with high EQ can recognise, control and express one's emotions perceive and assess other's emotion. On the contrary a person with high IQ can learn, understand and implement knowledge and possess abstract thinking and logical reasoning.<br>
                                → It is also argues that EQ level reflects for a successful life while a persons success in school depends on his IQ level.
                        </p>
                    <h4>
                        Why is it important?
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            Our ability to be aware and understand our own emotions can aid our awareness and understanding of the feelings of others. This capability will impact the way we communicate with other people specially in the workplace. Utilizing your emotional intelligence is critical to a persons success and valuable skills that can improve by training and practice.
