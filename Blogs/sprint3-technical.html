                    <p>In this blog entry we will try to simplify things as if talking to a non-technical person so that they can understand the basics of JavaSript, and how it relate to HTML and CSS. <br>
                        Also we will describe what is Document Object Model or DOM and will site some examples.

                        <b>"Analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS"</b>
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            Before we can build a website we must learn the difference between these two terms that goes hand-in-hand. <i>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</i>is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, <br>
                            and <i>CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets)</i> is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background colour.<br>
                            Even though they do have their key differences both are needed to complete a webpage interface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One way we can let our non-technical folks to understand the difference between the two is that we can compare building a website to building a house.<br>
                            If you think of it a house is made up of frames with different rooms and each rooms have different purpose that contains appliances. <br>
                            Like with webpages it has a header, body, footer. HTML is the main frame of the house, which organizes and presents elements of a webpage in a hierarchy manner. <br>
                            CSS on the other hand is like the interior design of each room, it will tell us what colours, size, position, shape of elements to put in.

                        <b>"Explain Control Flow and Loops using an example process from everyday life"</b>
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            <i><b>Control Flow</b></i> is the order in which JavaScript codes were executed. The code is run in order from the first line to the last line in file,<br>
                            unless the computer runs across structure that change the flow. We can compare the control flow to our daily tasks or to-do list like eat breakfast,<br>
                            go to the gym, wash up, go to work, meet up with a colleague etc. While on the other hand a <i><b>Loops</b></i> are basically much like a repeated code over and over until a certain condition was given.<br>
                            And this one can be describe as doing the exact normal routine that you do everyday, unless there's an unexpected event that can stop us from doing the usual.

                        <p>
                            A <i><b>Document Object Model</b></i> or otherwise known as DOM it is a standard for accessing and updating the webpage, it usually lies behind the scene and have a hierarchal structure.<br>
                            It is like a family tree with one single origin. In some resources it is separated into 3 different parts ( HTML DOM, XML DOM and Core DOM), as for this discussion we can focus on HTML Dom. <br>
                            HTML is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. We can easily manipulate the some HTML elements with it as well like tags, classes, IDs, attributes, etc.

                        <b>"Difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects</b>
                    </h4>
                        <p>
                            In learning JavaScript you need to know how to access data from arrays and objects. <i><b>Arrays</b></i> are used to store multiple values in a single variable. It has a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time.<br>
                            If you have to compute one million data points from a sensor, they should go in an array. Right there and then we can iterate over the array and do some computation on each element, uniformly the same computation for each one.<br>
                            However in <i><b>Object</b></i> represents one whole thing which has some number of specific properties that are represented by the members of the object. Like a persons first name, last name, phone number, address and email address.<br>
                            We can also access properties within an object by using dot notation or bracket {} notation.

                        <p>
                            <i><b>Functions</b></i> are codes inside of a programs that can be stored and be reused while keeping things organised to produce different results. It also help group the variables together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript function is defined with the keyword function, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by a commas:. The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets {}.
