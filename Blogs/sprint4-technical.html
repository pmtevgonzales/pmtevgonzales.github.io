                    <h4>II. Trying something NEW</h4>
                        <p>

                    <h4>III. Rubber Ducky</h4>
                        <p>
                            It is like explaining your coding problem in a simpler way. It can save you a ton of time when running into challenges with your code.<br>
                            Explain your code to someone or to an inanimate object. This is so that you can try and break down what it is you are trying to accomplish with the code that has got you stuck in the first place.<br>
                            By doing so, you are being forced to get out of your own head and actually explain what is going on with your code. Very often, by rubber ducking a problem, a developer can run into a solution without having to do any Googling whatsoever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I can say that I am confident enough to use this problem solving method as I usually used it whenever I get stuck on a complex problem.<br>
                            Eventhough it's complex I always try to go back and try to explain it to someone who's non-technical so that I can also try to simplify it to myself.<br>
                            Breaking it down to simpler terms makes me more confident about it as well as it tells me that I really do understand what's happening on the problem.<br>
                            Just what other people say for us to solve a problem we mush understand it.

                    <h4>IV. Reading Error Message</h4>
                        <p>
                            Having an error message present when your writing a code has a negative connotation, but we need to take note that errors can be a sign of progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Error messages consist of two parts, the error message and the stack trace. The error-message is “what’s wrong” — good error messages are helpful and tell you what you should do and bad error-messages sometimes look like foreign language. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Stack trace on the other hand is “where it’s wrong.” It has different names in different languages. In JavaScript it often go from the oldest entries in the bottom to the newest on the top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After I finished this sprint I can say that I have practice my error message reading fairly well and growing more confident on it.<br>
                            Whenever you're writting a code it is important that you hve the ability to understand the error message that is presented to you so that we can follow it up, and provide a new and improve code on our end.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>V. Console logging</h4>
                        <p>
                            It's the method that outputs a message to the web console. A function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined or just any message that needs to be displayed to the user.<br>
                            It may be a single string or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects. It also prints the element in an HTML like tree. It is also a simple and useful way to test some written codes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In times where I cannot fully understand the error message given to me when I run a test, console logging is one of the useful technique I'm constantly using.<br>
                            The perks of using this is that it saves you time to think of the values of the variable to check on your code.

                    <br>
                    <h4> VI. Googling</h4>
                        <p>
                            Searching in google to solve one problem in terms of writing a code is one helpful way we need to master as well so that we cannot be stuck in one problem.<br>
                            Nowadays its just easy to search things online just need to have he keywords and you can type and look for it. Remember that problems in writing a code is usual and thinking that someone out there have already face and solve the problem you have is an easier solution to it as well. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I can say that I master the art of googling, when I think about I use this technique 90% of the time. And if its still hard for you to understand it by documents or by article in google, you do have the luxury of learning it by video as well.
