      I’m Patricia you can call me Pat for short currently based in Wellington but I’m originally from the Philippines. I’m from a non-tech background I worked as a Physiotherapist back in the Philippines and also worked as a banker when we moved here to NZ. Also an expectant mum at the moment while learning how to code. The recent sprint and exercises really help me think harder of what I value in life. Most important value for me is my family, kindness, open mindedness and also my Christian faith as this acts as my moral compass in life.

        I’ve decided to join Dev Academy after attending codecamp back in April 2019 and hearing some of the speakers there really inspires me to shift careers from healthcare to development. I always like the technical side of things and felt disappointed that I could not fix things by myself. Another reason is that a career in web development gives you many possibilities, you can choose between various of work in programming and also various work outside it. I’m looking forward to meet everyone in the Piwakawaka cohort to learn from the team and more about how to be a full stack web developer.
